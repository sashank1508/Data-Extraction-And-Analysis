Our Success StoriesITWhat We DoResearch Academia Client BackgroundClient: A leading IT tech firm in the USAIndustry Type: ITProducts Services: IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaSOrganization Size: 200 The ProblemOur client, a leading research institution, faced challenges in collecting rich, engaging data through traditional survey methods. Participants often found surveys tedious and uninteresting, leading to low response rates and limited insights. Additionally, the client sought a way to accommodate participants who preferred verbal communication over written responses.Our SolutionTo address these challenges, proposed integrating Generative AI technology into the Qualtrics platform. This would allow for dynamic, AI-driven conversations with participants, making the survey experience more interactive and personalized. Additionally, we suggested implementing speech-to-text functionality to cater to participants who preferred vocalizing their responses.Solution ArchitectureIn solution involved integrating ChatGPT and Gemini AI models into the Qualtrics environment. Participants could engage in conversations with the AI either by typing or speaking their prompts. Speech inputs were processed using Gemini s speech-to-text capabilities, enabling seamless interaction with the AI models.Deliverables Integration of ChatGPT and Gemini AI with Qualtrics Speech-to-text functionality for verbal responses Enhanced participant engagement and data collection capabilitiesTech StackTools used Qualtrics,Chat-GPT Language techniques used JavaScript, APIs Models used GPT-3.5 Skills used Programming, AI Integration, Problem-solving, Communication, Adaptability, Testing, Project ManagementWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionReal-time Integration: Achieving seamless real-time integration of AI models with Qualtrics proved challenging due to the asynchronous nature of the platforms.Speech-to-Text Accuracy: Ensuring accurate transcription of speech inputs posed a technical challenge, especially in noisy environments or with accented speech.How the Technical Challenges were Solved:How the Technical Challenges were SolvedSimulated AI Model: To overcome real-time integration challenges, we implemented a simulated AI model that generated personalized responses based on user prompts.Enhanced Speech Processing: We fine-tuned Gemini s speech-to-text capabilities to improve accuracy and robustness, enabling reliable transcription of verbal inputs.Business ImpactImproved Participant Engagement: The implementation of AI-driven conversations led to higher participant engagement and increased survey completion rates.Richer Data Collection: Participants provided more detailed and nuanced responses, leading to richer datasets and deeper insights for the client s research initiatives.Project SnapshotsProject website urlDemo Preview:- VideoLink : project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.Contact DetailsThis solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
